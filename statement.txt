Feature Statement:
Our personalized travel recommendation system offers a straightforward interface for users to receive recommendations for points of interest near a destination they are interested in by entering it into the system. The system utilizes the Google Maps API to locate the area of interest and the Places API to find and display recommendations for nearby restaurants, museums, parks, and other sites of interest. Additionally, the system provides a real-time map view, allowing users to see the exact locations of recommended spots on the map, facilitating their travel planning process.
